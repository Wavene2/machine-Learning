Simple Linear Regression – Experience vs Salary

Description:

This project predicts salary based on years of experience using simple linear regression.

Uses gradient descent to find the best-fit line.

Visualizes the data points and regression line.

How It Works:

Load dataset (YearsExperience and Salary).

Initialize slope (m) and intercept (b).

Use gradient descent to update m and b to minimize error.

Plot the best-fit line on scatter plot.

Predict salary for new years of experience.
